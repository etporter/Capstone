This project contains default generated code from the PhoneGap desktop app.  (http://phonegap.com/)

To test this on a phone or tablet, you will need the PhoneGap Developer mobile app.  Otherwise, the code can be run in a browser or emulator by pointing your browser to "index.html" in the "www" folder.

All of the HTML JavaScript code that I wrote for this project is in the "www" folder.

"hooks", "platforms", and "plugins" contain auto-generated portions of the project.  Minor changes were made to the config.xml files.
